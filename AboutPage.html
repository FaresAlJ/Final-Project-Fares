    <p>Coming from the Middle East, I have seen and interpreted the world differently than my western peers. I see the beauty, pain, and chaos that our world has to offer. These feelings and reactions are what I try to bring through my work. I hope that my art can give those unfamiliar with the middle east, a sense of understanding of our culture.<br>
